          "description": "Naborly’s screening service provides landlords in the U.S. and Canada with rental forms they send to potential tenants, who fill in their employment, financial, and rental history for verification. Naborly feeds roughly 500 data points across credit, criminal, and rental history records sourced from private data vendors, governments, and open source databases to a machine learning system — SHERLY — that generates a risk score between 400 and 900 (the higher the better) within 90 minutes. From within an online dashboard, landlords can provide feedback and endorsements for tenants, who can use their profile to apply to future rental.<br><br>NaborlyShield, in addition to applicant screening it handles the eviction process in the event a tenant refuses to pay or can’t cover the first month’s rent. Naborly works with insolvent tenants to offer loans, and it will cover up to six months’ rent if a guest leaves without providing notice and up to $2,000 in damages if that guest causes damage to the property.",
